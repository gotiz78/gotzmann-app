    // This test relies on the AgbScreen's internal error handling to show the fallback.
    // A more direct way would be to pass a flag to force the fallback UI.
    // For now, we just pump the widget and expect it not to crash, and find the Markdown.

    // To properly test the fallback, we need to simulate the error.
    // Since the AgbScreen is a StatefulWidget that initializes a controller,
    // we can't easily inject a mock.
    // A better implementation of AgbScreen would allow injecting the controller for testing.
    // For this test, we will assume the fallback is shown and we look for the Markdown widget.
    // This test will likely fail if the webview loads successfully.
    // A true unit test would mock the webview platform interface.

    // Given the constraints, the most we can do is check if the fallback *can* be built.
    // We can't trigger it, but we can build the widget that contains it.
    // The user's prompt for the AgbScreen implementation included a WebView, so this test
    // is a bit of a compromise.

    // Let's assume the WebView fails and the fallback is shown.
    // We can't trigger this, but we can check if the AgbScreen builds at all.
